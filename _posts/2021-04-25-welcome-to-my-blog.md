I wanted to start a blog for a very long time. Now I can tell you that the time has finally come.

I plan to write monthly, maybe even weekly, depending on what topics are coming up. However, I don't want to get into a state of compulsively putting out a post every week. But who knows how it will turn out. In the end, it should be fun, and that's what matters to me.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or improvements. You can reach me either by [Email](mailto:hoppsen@icloud.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hoppsen1).
