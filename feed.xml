For this reason, when working with multiple people in one codebase, a linter and/or formatter is inevitable. For a couple of years, I’ve been utilizing a combination of SwiftLint and SwiftFormat. Most people rely solely on either SwiftLint or SwiftFormat, but I especially like the combination of SwiftLint AND SwiftFormat.... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>What Is the Reason for an Emoji in My LinkedIn Name</title><link href="https://hoppsen.com/posts/what-is-the-reason-for-an-emoji-in-my-linkedin-name/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What Is the Reason for an Emoji in My LinkedIn Name" /><published>2022-03-25T00:00:00+04:00</published> <updated>2022-03-25T00:00:00+04:00</updated> <id>https://hoppsen.com/posts/what-is-the-reason-for-an-emoji-in-my-linkedin-name/</id> <content src="https://hoppsen.com/posts/what-is-the-reason-for-an-emoji-in-my-linkedin-name/" /> <author> <name>Marcel Hoppe</name> </author> <category term="Personal" /> <summary> As much as I like automatization and would like to automate everything possible, certain things shouldn’t be automated in my eyes. One example is personal communication! Like most people in tech, I get tons of messages on LinkedIn. Not infrequently along the lines of I was really excited to come across your profile… or I was checking your profile, and you are the perfect match for our... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Improve Your Apps Accessibility by Gradually Introducing Dynamic Type Sizes</title><link href="https://hoppsen.com/posts/improve-your-apps-accessibility-by-gradually-introducing-dynamic-type-sizes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Improve Your Apps Accessibility by Gradually Introducing Dynamic Type Sizes" /><published>2021-07-09T00:00:00+04:00</published> <updated>2021-07-09T00:00:00+04:00</updated> <id>https://hoppsen.com/posts/improve-your-apps-accessibility-by-gradually-introducing-dynamic-type-sizes/</id> <content src="https://hoppsen.com/posts/improve-your-apps-accessibility-by-gradually-introducing-dynamic-type-sizes/" /> <author> <name>Marcel Hoppe</name> </author> <category term="Helper" /> <summary> After talking about my UIColor extension helper in my last post, I would like to discuss another helper extension I have used for quite some time now. This time it is not about colors; it is about another topic important to me, which does not get enough attention from product people in my eyes. I am referring to accessibility (short: AX). Whenever new projects are started, AX is neglected from... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Streamline Your Colors by Using System Colors under iOS 12 and Below</title><link href="https://hoppsen.com/posts/streamline-your-colors-by-using-system-colors-under-ios12-and-below/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Streamline Your Colors by Using System Colors under iOS 12 and Below" /><published>2021-06-26T00:00:00+04:00</published> <updated>2021-06-26T00:00:00+04:00</updated> <id>https://hoppsen.com/posts/streamline-your-colors-by-using-system-colors-under-ios12-and-below/</id> <content src="https://hoppsen.com/posts/streamline-your-colors-by-using-system-colors-under-ios12-and-below/" /> <author> <name>Marcel Hoppe</name> </author> <category term="Helper" /> <summary> At the time of writing, this might already be close to not being needed anymore soon. I am talking about getting Apple’s (not so) new System Colors under iOS 12 and below. What I mean by not being needed anymore is that with the release of iOS 15 in September, most apps will drop the support for iOS 12, given they follow the approach of supporting the current and one or two major releases b... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Hassle Free Merging of the Xcode Project File by Sorting It</title><link href="https://hoppsen.com/posts/sort-Xcode-project-file/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hassle Free Merging of the Xcode Project File by Sorting It" /><published>2021-05-15T00:00:00+04:00</published> <updated>2021-06-26T12:07:40+04:00</updated> <id>https://hoppsen.com/posts/sort-Xcode-project-file/</id> <content src="https://hoppsen.com/posts/sort-Xcode-project-file/" /> <author> <name>Marcel Hoppe</name> </author> <category term="Xcode" /> <summary> When working with multiple developers on one Xcode project, merging the project file can quickly become a hassle. I guess we have all been there. Especially if multiple features with lots of new files were added. I usually like to sort my files and folders. Mostly folders alphabetically up top, followed by all the remaining files A to Z: Extensions ├── Controls │ ├── UIBarButtonItem+DefaultB... </summary> </entry> </feed>
