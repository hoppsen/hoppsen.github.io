## Bio

---

💻 I’ve got a double degree (M.Sc.) in Computer Science and I’m experienced with Swift, iOS, Fastlane, and CI/CD. Throughout my career and personal projects, I’ve also worked with SwiftUI, Objective-C, Azure DevOps, Bitrise, Jenkins, and some non-iOS-related technologies.

📈 I know how to deliver everything from zero; over design, automated testing, continuous integration, continuous deployment, up to the App Store, and beyond.

🔥 I share a passion for sleek user-friendly design. I love writing clean and modular code, working with others on though problems, and to geek out over the small little details. For fun, I enjoy woodworking, traveling, and doing sports.

🏋🏼‍♂️ Strengths: Quality consciousness, Solution-oriented, Open-minded, Attention to detail
