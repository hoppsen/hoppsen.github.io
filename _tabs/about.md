## Bio

---

💻 I hold a double degree (M.Sc.) in Computer Science and specialize in Swift, iOS, Fastlane, and CI/CD. I’ve also tackled SwiftUI, Objective-C, Azure DevOps, Bitrise, Jenkins, and other technologies.

📈 I know how to deliver products end to end—through design, automated testing, continuous integration, continuous deployment, the App Store, and beyond.

🔥 I’m passionate about sleek user-friendly design, writing clean, modular code, solving tough problems with others, and focusing on the small details. Outside of tech, I enjoy woodworking, traveling, and sports.

🏋🏼‍♂️ **Strengths:** Quality-focused, Solution-oriented, Open-minded, Detail-attentive
